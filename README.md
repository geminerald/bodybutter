### User Requirements and Expectations

Online shopping is more popular now than ever before - this was true before the current world health crisis and has only become more true since then. 
As both supply and demand have grown the nature of what an online shop needs to be and needs to supply has changed.
Any online e-commerce platform needs to be easy to use an navigate or users will find another one that is easier. 
Similarly it will need to be secure - useing safe authentication and payment methods are now necessary for an e-commerce platform.

### Expectations

## Design

### Fonts

Key qualities needed for the font of an online web shop are simplicity, in order to not distract or slow the user down, and clarity - so that they can quickly absorb anything they see.
With these criteria in mind the Oswald font was chosen.

### Icons

### Colours

The colour palate was taken from [coolers](https://coolors.co/)

An image was uploaded which encapsulated the tone of the website and a colour scheme generated from this.

The individual colours are as outlined below:

- ![#fdb793](https://placehold.it/15/fdb793/000000?text=+) "Macaroni and Cheese" #fdb793 : This is used as a backgrould colour as it is a soft colour which goes well with most skin tones and doesn't pull focus.
- ![#0fa3b1](https://placehold.it/15/0fa3b1/000000?text=+) "Viridian Green" #0FA3B1 : This was chosen as a good contrast to the base colour - it shows up well against the softer peach colour and is reminiscent of colours seen in health spas.
- ![#b5e2fa](https://placehold.it/15/b5e2fa/000000?text=+) "Uranian Blue" #B5E2FA
- ![#f9f7f3](https://placehold.it/15/f9f7f3/000000?text=+) "Baby Powder" #F9F7F3
- ![#eddea4](https://placehold.it/15/eddea4/000000?text=+) "Medium Champagne" #EDDEA4
